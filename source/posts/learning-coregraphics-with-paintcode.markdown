I am not a designer. Nobody has ever confused me with one or accused me of being one. However, I like good design, and have come a long way in appreciating all that goes into it. I'm at the point where I can look at something and not only understand that I like it, but also (some of) why I like it.

However, I have not yet made the jump to being able to create those 'lickable' elements that are both beautiful and invite interaction.

Lately, I've been finding small UI elements in websites and apps and trying to re-implement them on my own. It's fun, and it gives me a chance to really look at the details of how other UI's work. When you focus on the details of how something works, you start to see all of the little decisions that were made along the way...and you start to appreciate how difficult a skill it is to make something beautiful.

I figured writing about this will help me solidify what I learn, and others may find it useful.

Late last year (2013) I wound up at [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/en/) and scrolled down their site to see what I thought was a really cool counter that showed how many ToDo items they had at that very second. It pulled those numbers in via a websocket connection that received a message every second or so and updated the UI in a rather interesting way. It looks like that counter is gone now, so I can only show you a bit of my re-creation.
